# Event Impact Model — Research Memo

## Hypothesis
Regulatory/financial filing events (SEC 8-K / 10-Q / 10-K) contain information that can be mapped to a tradable timestamp and predict short-horizon post-event returns.

## Data
- Universe: SEC company tickers snapshot (config-driven)
- Prices: Stooq daily OHLCV (benchmark: SPY)
- Events: SEC EDGAR submissions (acceptedDateTime), filtered by forms

### Limitations
- Universe snapshot may imply survivorship bias unless historical membership is used.
- Stooq coverage is incomplete for some tickers (missing data leads to dropped events).
- Daily granularity: intraday timing compressed into effective trade date.

## Event Timestamping & Alignment
- Event time extracted from SEC `acceptanceDateTime` (UTC) and converted to US/Eastern.
- Session bucket: premarket / intraday / afterhours.
- Effective trade date mapping uses NYSE trading calendar logic (including weekends/holidays).

## Event Study Method
- Returns: close-to-close daily returns.
- Estimation window: [-120, -21] trading days.
- Event window: [-10, +5] trading days.
- Abnormal returns: market model vs SPY, OLS per ticker.
- Outputs:
  - AR by tau
  - CAR / CAAR
  - Pre-trend check: CAR[-10,-2] ~ 0
  - Multiple testing control for subgroups: Benjamini–Hochberg (FDR)

## Predictive Modeling
- Target (MVP): CAR[+1,+5] from abnormal returns.
- Features (pre-event only): momentum, volatility, liquidity proxy, calendar features, event meta.
- Models:
  - Baselines: Ridge (regression), Logistic on sign(y)
  - Strong model: LightGBM regression
- CV: walk-forward with embargo (purged-style guardrail)

## Backtest (Tradable Signal)
- Portfolio construction: cross-sectional long top-q / short bottom-q per formation day.
- Execution: configurable delay and holding horizon.
- Costs: proportional to turnover (bps).
- Constraints: max positions, name cap, gross exposure target.
- Optional: portfolio-level vol targeting (annualized target, rolling lookback).

- `reports/figures/*`
- `reports/event_study_summary.csv`
- `data/processed/cv_metrics*.csv`
- `reports/backtest_engine_summary*.csv`

## Robustness
- Sensitivity grid: delay × horizon × q × cost (robustness only; not used to pick “best” config).
- Subgroup tests (form, session bucket) with FDR control.

## Failure Modes / Risks
- Timestamp errors (afterhours → wrong effective trade date) can create false alpha.
- Leakage via feature availability timing (must remain strictly pre-event).
- Universe bias + missing data interactions.
- Small sample issues in certain subgroups.

## Next Steps
- Expand universe and improve coverage of price data.
- Add richer features (sector, size, ADV, etc.) and strict as-of handling.
- Improve execution realism (open execution, slippage models, capacity constraints).
- Add report artifact build in CI (HTML/PDF).
